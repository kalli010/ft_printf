# ft_printf

## Description
`ft_printf` is a custom implementation of the classic `printf` function in C. This project aims to replicate the functionality of the standard `printf` function, offering a learning experience in handling variable arguments, format specifiers, and basic I/O operations in C.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kalli010/ft_printf.git
```
Compile with Make:
```
cd ft_printf
make
```

## Usage
Include the header in your C file:
```c
#include "ft_printf.h"
```
Use `ft_printf` just like the standard `printf`:
```c
ft_printf("Hello, %s!", "world");
```

## Features
- Handles various format specifiers such as:
  - `%d` for integers
  - `%u` for unsigned integers
  - `%s` for strings
  - `%c` for characters
  - `%x` for hexadecimal numbers (lowercase)
  - `%X` for hexadecimal numbers (uppercase)
  - `%p` for pointers
